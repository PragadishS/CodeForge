üìã Overview

CodeForge is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that provides an online judge system for coding practice. 
It allows users to browse coding problems, submit solutions in C/C++, and receive immediate feedback on their submissions including execution time, 
memory usage, and test case results.

‚ú® Features

User Authentication: Secure registration and login system with JWT
Problem Repository: Browse, filter, and search coding problems by difficulty and tags
Code Editor: Built-in Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting for C and C++
Automatic Code Evaluation: Solutions are compiled and run against test cases in a secure environment
Real-time Feedback: Detailed results showing execution time, memory usage, and test case status
Problem Creation: Create and share your own coding problems with custom test cases
User Profiles: Track solved problems and submission history

üîß Code Evaluation System

CodeForge uses a secure code execution system that:

Receives submitted code in C or C++
Compiles the code (for C/C++) in a controlled environment using gcc/g++
Executes the code against multiple test cases with strict time and memory limits
Streams test case input to the program and captures output
Monitors real-time memory usage and execution time
Verifies the output against expected results
Provides detailed feedback including:

Status (Accepted, Wrong Answer, Compilation Error, Runtime Error, Time Limit Exceeded)
Execution time and memory usage
Details of any failed test cases with expected vs. actual output
Error messages for debugging
